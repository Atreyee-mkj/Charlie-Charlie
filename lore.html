  <h1>ðŸ“– The Lore of Charlie</h1>
  <p>
    They say Charlie was once a boy trapped between worlds â€” neither spirit nor shadow.  
    His whispers linger in the air where games blur with belief.  
    Children once called to him for answers... but few remember what they asked.

    The modern "Charlie Charlie" challenge is a modern incarnation of the Spanish game Juego de la Lapicera.
    It has been played for generations in Spanish-speaking countries, functioning similarly to a "poor man's Ouija board"
  </p>

  <p>
    Those who mocked the ritual claimed the pencils moved on their own.  
    Those who didnâ€™t â€” never spoke again.  
    Charlie listens. Always.
